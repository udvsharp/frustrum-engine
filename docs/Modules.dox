// TODO: format
- Each modules has the following structure:
<module_name>
    /include - public headers directory
    /private_include - private headers directory
    /src - sources directory
    CMakeLists.txt - build dir

Symlinks are created in build dir so include paths are prefixed with 'frustrum/<module_name>
Module name can be omitted if flags in CMake are specified
